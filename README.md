# BIScienceAssignment
Had to use specific Scala and Spark versions that will work together with all functions I needed to use.
This meant that I had to compromise, as the Spark version I had to use has a known bug with Windows (which I work on), and cannot "saveAsTextFile".
Therefore, I had to use "println" method.
